# Plantie - Plant Identifier and manager.
## Overview
This plant identifier is developed in Android Studio and backed by a customized Yolov5 trained on small dataset we collect manually. For backend code please refer to https://github.com/nhtlongcs/yolov5-flask

Open the projects in Android Studio and use your mobile phone as a simulator. Refer to https://developer.android.com/studio/run/device for instructions if you haven't connected one.
